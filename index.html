	    	I'am a Ph.D. candidate in the Media School at Indiana University</span>. 
		My research primarily investigates antecedents and consequences of news use. 
		I use political and social psychological perspectives to investigate how individual 
		differences such as political affiliation and personality traits play out in the 
		ways how people select, engage, and make sense of news content and political 
		information in general.

	<p>
		I am currently working on my dissertation project, “Personalized and Emotionalized 
		News Media Coverage of Muslim Victims: A test of Empathy-Altruism Mechanisms.” 
		My dissertation project examines empathy-altruism mechanisms in a mediated 
		inter-group contact context. I am specifically interested in whether and 
		if so how news stories featuring victims of racial discrimination stimulate 
		pro-social behavioral motivations by promoting empathy towards the victims.

	<p>												
		I use a wide range of methodological approaches including but not limited to experiments, 
		surveys, secondary data analysis, and computerized textual analysis. My research has 
		appeared in Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly, Mass Communication and Society, 
		and International Journal of Communication.
